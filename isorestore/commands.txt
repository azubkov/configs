How to restore system from existing linux snapshot

1) Have a .iso file
mysuse.iso

2) Run system from Live Cd or Usb stick
3) Mount both hdd disks: with target partition and with .iso file
4) sudo su
5) dd if=/dev/sdb1/mysuse.iso of=/dev/sda1 bs=512k
6) reboot to Usb Stick
   Now we will restore grub entry, so change root required.
7) sudo su
8) fdisk -l
9) mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
mount -B /proc /mnt/proc
mount -B /sys /mnt/sys
mount -B /dev /mnt/dev
mount -B /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts
chroot /mnt
grub2-install
exit
reboot
10) mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
cd /mnt/etc/
mcedit fstab
##here comment out all illegal paths, like old partition numbers sdb9, etc
11)##chroot again
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
exit
reboot

12) if no kernels detected by grub:
##chroot again
mkinitrd
mkinitramfs




13) Know hard drive UUIDs for fast fstab:
sudo blkid

Creating an Iso
-----------------------------------------------------------
14.0) List drives to know who is who:
sudo fdisk -l
sudo lsblk
sudo lsblk -o name, fstype, size, mountpoint, label

14.1) Copy iso from partition to file:
sudo su
dd if=/dev/sdb1 of=/dev/sde2/myxx.iso bs=512k

If commnad says that read/write not possible,
then try to mount locations at least somewhere:

cd /mnt
mkdir from
mkdir to
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/from
mount /dev/sde2 /mnt/to

to unmount use following:
unmount /mnt/to

14.2) after iso file completed, run system from ubs flash.
THis is required for unpacking iso file.
It contains root structure(/) which will intersect with our original system root(/)

14.3) prepare another partition on any temporary hard drive.
unpack your iso there using:
dd if=/dev/sde2/myxx.iso of=/dev/sde3 bs=512k

if any r\w errors appear on the same start, use mount command to any available folder and re-run dd

14.4) after extracting target iso to target temp partition, resize it as needed using graphical gparted
14.5) after resize of partition done, dd it again to iso file.
Now instead of your original hdd size (100Gib) file uses only really allocated space (20Gib)
14.6) iso image complete, keep it and enjoy


14) graphically resize partitions:
gparted
